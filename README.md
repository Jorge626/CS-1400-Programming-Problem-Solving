# CS 1400 Programming and Problem Solving
Projects from my class CS 1400 Introduction to Programming and Problem Solving
I took this course at California State Polytechnic University, Pomona

There are 3 Projects in this repository. 

- One project uses encryption/decryption techniques to cipher a text. 
- Another project implements the Stack and Queue Data Structures using Arrays. 
- The last project utilizes recursion techniques to solve various problems.

## Things I learned in this course
- Problem-solving methods
- Object-oriented concepts including classes, inheritance, and polymorphism
-  Basic control structures and data types
-  File I/O and exception handling.
